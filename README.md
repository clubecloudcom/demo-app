# Simple Express / Node.js hello world app

I needed a demo application.  Since then I've added little bits and pieces to expand.

Contains:

  * A simple Express `Hello World!` on port 8000
  * A Dockerfile to deploy with Docker locally or in the cloud
  * Kubernetes yaml files for creating a service and a load balancer.

# TBD 

A better app.
